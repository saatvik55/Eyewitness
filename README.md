# Eyewitness App

The Eyewitness App is a mobile application created using Flutter that allows users to report crimes and incidents as they happen, providing real-time updates to law enforcement and other members of the community. 

## Technologies Used

- Flutter: a mobile app development framework used to build the app.
- Firebase: a cloud-based backend platform used for user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.
- Google Maps API: used for location services and geo-tagging of reported incidents.

## Key Highlights

- Users can quickly and easily report incidents through the app, including photos and videos as evidence.
- Reports are automatically geo-tagged, providing accurate location information for law enforcement.
- The community page allows users to view and comment on incidents reported by others in their area, creating a sense of shared responsibility and accountability.
- The app includes a panic button feature, which allows users to quickly notify law enforcement in emergency situations.

## Future Goals

- Implement machine learning via TensorFlow to automatically verify the authenticity of reported crimes.
- Incorporate blockchain technology by using nodes as blocks on each crime update on the community page.
- To publish fully functional on Application services like Play Store , App Store and also deploy a web version.

## Usage

To use the app, open it on your mobile device and follow the prompts to report an incident. You can also view incidents reported by others in your area on the community page.
